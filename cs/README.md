# Recommendations

Based on the uncovered insights, the following recommendations have been provided : 

- **Target High-Value Products:** Coffee Beans, being the top-performing product, can benefit from a seasonal "Buy One Get One Free" offer. This would encourage bulk purchases, especially during colder months when customers are more likely to brew coffee at home. Introducing this deal a month in advance would help maximize sales.

- **Boost Sales During Slow Months:** January and February are typically lower-earning months. To counter this, implement seasonal offers such as reward cards or a complimentary drink of choice on customers' birthdays. This strategy can help increase customer engagement, boost sign-ups, and drive revenue during the quieter winter period.

- **Optimize Operating Hours and Product Categories:** Since 8PM is the lowest-performing hour, introducing end-of-day deals with attractive discounts can help drive sales and engage customers. Additionally, consider rotating product categories or swapping underperforming ones with new offerings to generate fresh interest and appeal.

- **Customer Feedback for Continuous Improvement:** At the end of each season, send out surveys to gather customer feedback on service quality, product satisfaction, and overall experience. This valuable insight can help fine-tune offerings and improve the overall business performance.
